What I Learn in this Session: 
    
       1. How to implement SQLite Database.
       2. How to implement RecyclerView
       
   * Database : This Part is not that tough as i have familiar with SQLite,
   * RecyclerView : It took some time to figure out why the ListView is not Appearing.
                    (It requires to set layoutManager of recyclerView to Set View Content.)
                    
   * Previously Using : i'm Generally use ListView with ViewHolders for displaying content,
                    and i thought its same as RecyclerView but they have lots of difference,
                    will defiantly create some sample of RecyclerView Later.
